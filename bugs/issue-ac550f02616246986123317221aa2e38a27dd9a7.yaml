title: Create a FormArray widget
desc: |-
  A FormArray widget is needed to support array definitions in Json schemas.
  
  This widget should create a list of subwidgets that match the schema array definition, allowing entries to be added and removed. The widget should automatically create as many subwidgets as necissary when attr('value', [string, string, ...]) is set.
